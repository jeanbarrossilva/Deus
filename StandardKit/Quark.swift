/// A quark (q) is an elementary fermion ``Particle`` which is confined — cannot exist by itself in
/// nature — and bound to at least another one by gluons via strong force. It is the only
/// ``Particle`` in the Standard Model which experiences each of the four fundamental forces:
/// strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitational.
///
/// ## Classification
///
/// There are six flavors of quarks, divided into two ``Particle/charge``-based types and three
/// generations:
///
/// Flavor   | Generation | Spin   | Charge | Type    | Lagrangian mass               |
/// -------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------- | ----------------------------- |
/// Up       | 1ˢᵗ        | ½ *ħ*  | +⅔ e   | Up      | 2.3 ± 0.7 ± 0.5 MeV/*c*²      |
/// Down     | 1ˢᵗ        | ½ *ħ*  | -⅓ e   | Down    | 4.8 ± 0.5 ± 0.3 MeV/*c*²      |
/// Strange  | 2ⁿᵈ        | ½ *ħ*  | -⅓ e   | Down    | 95 ± 5 MeV/*c*²               |
/// Charm    | 2ⁿᵈ        | ½ *ħ*  | +⅔ e   | Up      | 1.275 ± 0.025 GeV/*c*²        |
/// Bottom   | 3ʳᵈ        | ½ *ħ*  | -⅓ e   | Down    | 4.18 ± 30 GeV/*c*²            |
/// Top      | 3ʳᵈ        | ½ *ħ*  | +⅔ e   | Up      | 173.21 ± 0.51 ± 0.7 GeV/*c*²  |
///
/// > Note: The names up, down, strange, charm, bottom and top have no intrinsic meaning nor do they
/// describe the behavior of such quarks; they were chosen arbitrarily, with the sole purpose of
/// differentiating each flavor or type.
///
/// ## Role in matter composition
///
/// Ordinary matter, such as nucleons and, therefore, atoms, is composed by 1ˢᵗ-generation quarks
/// due to their stability: they have a decay width Γ ≈ 0 and, consequently, a lifetime τ ≈ ∞,
/// because them being the lightest ones prohibits their decay to lighter — unknown or nonexistent —
/// ``Particle``s. Scenarios beyond the Standard Model in which they do decay are those of Grand
/// Unification Theories, which theorize that the aforementioned four fundamental forces were one in
/// the very early universe (first picosecond of its existence) and, as described by the theory of
/// proton decay by Andrei Sakharov, such quarks have τ ≈ 10³⁴ years; nonetheless, they are
/// disconsidered here.
///
/// As for 2ⁿᵈ- and 3ʳᵈ-generation quarks, their masses, ~20 to ~300 times greater than that of the
/// heaviest 1ˢᵗ-generation quark, alongside their ability to emit a W⁺ or W⁻ via weak interaction
/// and, subsequently, decay to lighter quarks, make them unstable and result in lifetimes ⪅ 173 GeV
/// (5 × 10⁻²⁵ s); these are, therefore, mostly present in cosmic rays and other high-energy
/// collisions. Of the four, the top quark is the only one which is heavy and decays fast enough to
/// the extent of being unable to hadronize (form a hadron).
