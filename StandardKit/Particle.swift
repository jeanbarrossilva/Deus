/// Subatomic excitation of an underlying field, which exhibits discrete interactions with other
/// fields. Differs from vacuum fluctuations or delocalized modes on such field in that it is
/// localized: it has a wavepacket of location. Such localization is made possible by
/// collapse-like, interpretation-defined consequence of measuring its wavefunction Ψ(*x*, *t*),
/// where *x* is the position and *t* is the time.
///
/// ## Classification
///
/// Particles are divided into two families:
///
/// Family    | Spin              | Characterization                                                                                                                        |
/// --------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
/// Boson     | s ∈ ℤ × *ħ*       | **Bose–Einstein distribution**: there can be an integer multiple of *nQ* number of particles in a concentration per unit of its volume. |
/// Fermion   | s ∈ (ℤ + ½) × *ħ* | **Pauli exclusion**: identical particles of such family cannot have equal quantum states in the same spacetime.                         |
