/// transformation under the SU(3) gauge symmetry whose field, SU(3)₍color₎ or gluon field, is
/// quantized as gluons, boson ``Particle``s responsible for binding the ``Quark``s of a ``Hadron``
/// by mediating the strong interactions.
///
/// Each of the three directions of the vector (red, green and blue) are amplitudes when unmeasured;
/// upon measurement, the probability of this charge being in such direction is produced according
/// to the Born rule. Finally, a definite color is determined, resulting in one of the cases of this
/// enum.
///
/// These three directions are intrinsically equal to each other: they can be swapped via an SU(3)
/// transformation and the overall state of the system will not be modified. They affect, however,
/// the interactions to be had with them by the gluons, which carry specific color-anticolor
/// combinations; these can, in turn…
///
/// - …annihilate one direction and redirect;
/// - influence the phase of a direction but not redirect the vector; or
/// - be effectless.
///
/// > Note: None of the two mentioned concepts, color and direction, refer to their classical
/// description (respectively, a visual perception of the electromagnetic spectrum and a projection
/// of physical movement from one point toward another). These are uniquely-quantum properties of a
/// ``ColoredParticle``.
