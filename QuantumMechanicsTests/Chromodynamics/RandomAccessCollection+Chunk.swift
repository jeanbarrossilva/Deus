extension RandomAccessCollection {
  /// Divides this `Collection` into chunks of `size`.
  ///
  /// ## Difference from that of swift-algorithms
  ///
  /// The swift-algorithms package, as of 1.2.1, provides an extension function for dividing a
  /// `Collection` into chunks: `chunks(ofCount:)`. Our implementation, however, provides control
  /// over whether partiality is allowed or prohibited; in contrast, `chunks(ofCount:)` presupposes
  /// that partiality is always permitted, never ignoring the last chunk when its size is greater
  /// than that which has been specified.
  ///
  /// Apart from this distinction, and although some optimazations are not present here (such as
  /// lazy chunk evaluation), the contents of the return value of both functions are the same.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - size: Quantity in which the elements will be grouped.
  ///   - allowsPartiality: Whether the last chunk can contain less than `size` elements due to the
  ///     `count` of this `Collection` being insufficient for a division into such size. When
  ///     `false`, remaining elements will be ignored.
  ///
  ///     E.g., given `self` = `[2, 4, 8, 12, 16]` and `size` = 2:
  ///
  ///     `allowsPartiality` | Result                    |
  ///     ------------------ | ------------------------- |
  ///     `false`            | `[[2, 4], [8, 12]]`       |
  ///     `true`             | `[[2, 4], [8, 12], [16]]` |
  /// - Returns:
  ///   Sizing               | Result                |
  ///   -------------------- | --------------------- |
  ///   `size` ≤ 0           | `[]`                  |
  ///   `size` ≥ `count`     | `[self[...]]`         |
  ///   0 < `size` < `count` | ≤-`size`-sized chunks |
