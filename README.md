<p>Deus is a simulator of particle physics whose aim is to simulate the genesis of the universe, from the Big Bang (t → 0) to the Dark Ages (t ≈ 370,000 y). It can be adjusted in terms of the laws of physics which are applied, ranging from classical to quantum, allowing for sparing of computing resources for lower-range hardware and visualization of simulated scenarios wherein only Newtonian physics are employed versus those in which quantization is taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Our current, state-of-the-art knowledge is still unable to state, precisely, <i>how</i> the Big Bang occurred — specifically up until the Planck epock (t = 10⁻⁴³ s).</p>
