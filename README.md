<p>Deus is a simulator of particle physics whose aim is to simulate the genesis of the universe, from the Big Bang (t → 0) to the dark ages (t ≈ 370,000 a). It can be adjusted in terms of the laws of physics which are applied, ranging from classical to quantum, allowing for sparing of computing resources for lower-range hardware and visualization of simulated scenarios wherein only Newtonian physics are employed versus those in which quantization is taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Our current, state-of-the-art knowledge is still unable to state, precisely, <i>how</i> the Big Bang occurred — specifically up until the Planck epoch (t = 10⁻⁴³ s).</p>

<h2>Developing Deus</h2>

<p>Some parts of the development process are documented by the author himself in his video series <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHiVqgQ7o8farBkJrCzFdJe6hsDT3ight"><cite>Deus: Simulando o Universo</cite></a> (<cite>Deus: Simulating the Universe</cite>), in which the thinking behind the overall structure of the project is explained and important concepts regarding the physics themselves are taught.</p>
